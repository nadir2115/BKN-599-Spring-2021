# Residual vs Fitted Values Plot
It is a scatter plot of residuals on the y axis and fitted values on the x axis to detect non-linearity, unequal error variances, and outliers.

## Characteristics of a well behaved residual vs fitted plot:
The residuals spread randomly around the 0 line indicating that the relationship is linear.
The residuals form an approximate horizontal band around the 0 line indicating homogeneity of error variance.
No one residual is visibly away from the random pattern of the residuals indicating that there are no outliers.
